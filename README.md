### Contribute
If you want to contribute to this repo, I am looking specifically for this to be responsive. I am leaving that open for two reasons 1.) I don't have time to make it responsive, and 2.) I would love for this to be a PR for someone participating in #Hacktoberfest.

1. Fork the repo
2. Clone the repo to your local machine

`git clone REPO NAME`

3. Make changes in a feature branch

`yourname/feature-responsive`

4. Submit a PR
